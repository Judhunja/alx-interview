The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

###### Concepts Learned:

- Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

- Sieve of Eratosthenes: An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.

- Game Theory: Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.

- Dynamic Programming/Memoization: Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.
